An Insider Threat Detection project using the CICIDS2019 dataset focuses on identifying malicious activities originating from within an organization. It
integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Feedforward Convolutional
Neural Network (FCNN) models for enhanced accuracy. The LSTM captures
temporal patterns in user behavior and system access data, while the FCNN
identifies spatial features in network interactions. This dual-model approach
effectively differentiates insider threats from normal activities.
